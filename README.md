   excitability, behaviour characteristics

## Warning
I'm not providing color and test-interpretations set for public.

If you want to use this test, contact me.

You can implement your custom color set, it is so easy. I'm providing config for it.

You have to accept that any test results depends to many factors:
    lighting, noises, presence of other people, color profile, time of day and others. 

Don't take the test results as the ultimate truth.
